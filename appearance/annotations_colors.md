# Colors and their meanings for annotations in pdf


These are the usual colors :art: and their corresponding meanings that I prefer to use often while annotating :memo: my pdf documents. *However, as per need or lack of utilities, somewhere somethings may differ.*


I plan to use a consistent workflow from now :date: (Jun 25, 2020), *so older annotated pdfs/docs may differ (though not greatly).*


I will also make sure to use minimum colors and more contrasting colors, so that one can easily differentiate among them even if the color-rendering is different on other computers/softwares.
