# Colors and their meanings for annotations in pdf


These are the usual colors :art: and their corresponding meanings that I prefer to use often while annotating my pdf <i class="nf nf-mdi-file_pdf"></i> 

&#xf1c1;



<span style="font-family:Hack; font-size:4em;">LOVE!</span>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span> 

documents. However, as per need or lack of utilities, somewhere somethings may differ.


I plan to use a consistent workflow from now (Jun 25, 2020), so older annotated pdfs/docs may differ (though not greatly).


I will also make sure to use minimum colors and more contrasting colors, so that one can easily differentiate among them even if the color-rendering is different on other computers/softwares.
