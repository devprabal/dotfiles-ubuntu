# Banana Fish Color Scheme

*[Banana Fish](https://anilist.co/anime/100388/BANANA-FISH/) is one of my favourite animes that inspired me to create a color scheme out of it.*

## Ports

**This is a WIP**, and hopefully, I will apply this color scheme to more programs that I use on a daily basis. For now, the color scheme is applied to the following programs -  

- [x] [gnome-shell-theme (3.36)](https://github.com/devprabal/Adwaita-bananafish)
- [x] [alacritty](../../dotfiles/config/alacritty/bananafish_color.yml)
- [ ] gtk-3.0
- [ ] vim
- [ ] VSCode
- [ ] gedit
- [ ] firefox
- [ ] telegram
- [ ] gnome-terminal


It is basically a dark color scheme and I have no idea if I will make a light color scheme or not.

:pencil: NOTE: The color scheme uses the bright variants for the dim ones, and as such has only 8 colors in order to keep colors to a minimum. However, at times, more than one shades for black and white are used.
