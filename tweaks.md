Some configs that I use are shown in the screenshots below -

![fonts](appearance/gnome-tweaks%202.png)
![keyboard and mouse](appearance/gnome-tweaks%203.png)
![windows](appearance/gnome-tweaks%204.png)

**Other settings for Title bar, top bar, etc. are trivial and can be done at the time when configuring the above settings.**
